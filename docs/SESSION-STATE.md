# Session state — finalization plan progress

Working branch: **`finalization`** (10 commits ahead of the redesign work).
Last updated at the end of the shift-foundation + Edge-ingestion session.

## Done & validated (committed)
- **Phase 0** — proxy relabeling (`zone_entry_proxy_*`), model-layer conventions
  (`models_ml/`, `insight_engine/`, `docs/methodology/`, `frontend/src/config/metrics.ts`),
  dbt vars, README + Makefile. dbt compile + pytest + frontend build all green.
- **Phase 1.1 — shift charts (COMPLETE)**
  - Ingestion: `get_shift_charts`, loader `raw_shift_charts`, `scripts/ingest_shifts.py`,
    `backfill_historical.py --tables {boxscore,pbp,shiftcharts}` (resumable shift-only path),
    daily DAG wired, `scripts/smoke_ingest_shiftcharts.py`.
  - **Full history backfilled: ~13,850 games, 2015-16→2025-26, 0 failures.**
  - Models: `stg_shifts` → `int_shift_segments` (53.1M rows) → `int_segment_context`
    (4.5M) → `int_on_ice_events` (4.3M), all materialized as tables.
  - **Validated: 81,762 goals at 99.95% on-ice attribution; ~48 5v5 min/game every season.**
  - Key corrections to the plan: typeCode **517 = real shifts, 505 = goal annotations**
    (plan had it backwards); event→segment uses **(start, end]** (goals carry the
    shift-end timestamp); excluded 0.01% degenerate/corrupt durations.
- **Phase 1.2 — Edge ingestion layer (DONE; staging/marts NOT yet)**
  - **Real endpoint family discovered** (plan's `/v1/edge/skater-detail` was dead):
    `/v1/edge/{entity}-{report}/{id}/{season}/{gameType}`. Reports: skater
    skating-speed-detail / skating-distance-detail / shot-speed-detail /
    shot-location-detail / **zone-time** (no `-detail` suffix); goalie
    save-percentage-detail; team shot-location-detail. See `scripts/EDGE_FINDINGS.md`
    + saved payloads in `scripts/edge_samples/` (gitignored).
  - `get_edge_skater/goalie/team`, `scripts/explore_edge.py`, `scripts/refresh_edge.py`
    (resumable, `make edge-refresh SEASON=...`), `raw_edge_*` sources + loader.
  - Only a 15-entity sample ingested so far (2024-25) — run a full refresh per season.

## Next up (fresh-context work)
1. **Phase 1.2 finish — Edge staging/marts/backend.** `stg_edge_skaters/goalies/teams`
   (parse the 5 report shapes from `edge_samples/`), `mart_edge_player_profile` /
   `mart_edge_team_profile`, `GET /players/{id}/edge` + `/teams/{id}/edge`,
   `backfill_edge.py`, DAG weekly task. Zone-time gives oz/nz/dz + zone starts by strength.
2. **Phase 1.3** — faceoffs-by-zone (stats REST), game landing/right-rail, partner odds
   (internal only), glossary, standings-by-date. Each: code + `scripts/smoke_ingest_*`.
3. **Phase 1.4** — ppt-replay spike + backfill floor extension to 2010-11.
4. **Incremental refactor (important):** make `int_shift_segments`/`int_segment_context`/
   `int_on_ice_events` incremental by game so the nightly run doesn't rescan 11 seasons
   (the monolithic build is ~17 min and needs the raised timeout below).

## Environment gotchas (bit us this session)
- Use the project venv or `pip install -U "google-cloud-bigquery>=3.20"` — older versions
  fail with `_blocking_poll() got an unexpected keyword argument 'retry'`. Pinned in requirements.
- dbt: always `--target dev` locally; the segmentation rebuild needs
  `timeout_seconds` raised in `dbt/profiles.yml` (set to 1800 locally; default 300 times out).
  profiles.yml is gitignored — set this in any new environment.
- Always `set -a; source .env; set +a` and export `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` first.

## Resume commands
```bash
# env
cd /Users/codytownsend/Desktop/nhl/NIR && set -a && source .env && set +a
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$PWD/secrets/nhl-intel-sa.json
# full Edge refresh for a season (when ready to populate beyond the sample)
python -m scripts.refresh_edge --season 2025-26
# explore real Edge payloads (already saved under scripts/edge_samples/)
python scripts/explore_edge.py --season 20242025
```

## Operating model (from docs/HANDOFF-*.md)
I write code + `scripts/smoke_ingest_*` per surface; long backfills/training run in the
background (I have network + BigQuery access here). Model jobs get `--dry-run/--sample/--resume`
+ a pasteable report. Archetype naming (Phase 4.2) is the one human-in-the-loop step.
No placeholders/mock data — features die or are labeled proxies when the API can't support them.
